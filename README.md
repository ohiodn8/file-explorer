# FileExplorer

This is a file explorer (as its name suggests). With this gem enabled in your app, you should be able to browse your server directory on the browser. 
This gem acts as a gui to your server, and you're able to view the directories and files; you have the ability to delete files and folders; (a toggle switch hides the delete feature). 

The application was originally a Rails app by 
<a href="https://github.com/adrientoub">adrientoub</a>. I found the app, and was excited about it,
and with his permission, I went ahead to gemify the app and redesign some features. Check out the original work here =>
